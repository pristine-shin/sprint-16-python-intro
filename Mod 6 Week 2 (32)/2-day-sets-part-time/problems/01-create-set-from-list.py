# Given a list of items, create a set from the list. Note the differences with
# performing the same action in JavaScript.

# Write your code here.
produce = ['apple', 'apple', 'apple', 'banana', 'cucumber', 'cucumber', 'nectarine']

shopping_list = set(produce)
print(shopping_list)

# (Hint: Does declaring a new set require any keywords like `new`?) NOPE
